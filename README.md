# Serendipity

A mobile app designed to eliminate choice paralysis in entertainment discovery. 

Users can choose from the following mediums:

Each medium has it's own dedicated screen having the purpose of allowing the user to fetch content from medium specific tables. 
## Features

* Delete content from tables
* Populate "current" tables to keep track of what one is enjoying at the moment
* Add to finished section to retrieve additional data about content
* Navigate directly to content in Spotify/Google
* View all items in a specific table


## Tech Stack

**Client:** React Native, TypeScript, ngrok, Expo

**Server:** Node, Express, Redis, Python

**Database:** BigQuery


## Lessons Learned

The biggest thing I learned while building this project was how to create a mobile application. Historically, I'd only built web apps to this point, but I wanted to build something that I could easily access on the go.

Like what I learned, the biggest challenge I faced was building a mobile application. I'm well-versed in React, but React Native is a different beast. The workflow is very similar, but the features are noticeably different. 


## Roadmap

- Authentication for multiple users
