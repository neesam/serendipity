## Lessons Learned

The biggest thing I learned while building this project was how to create a mobile application. Historically, I'd only built web apps to this point, but I wanted to build something that I could easily access on the go.

Like what I learned, the biggest challenge I faced was building a mobile application. I'm well-versed in React, but React Native is a different beast. The workflow is very similar, but the features are noticeably different. 


## Roadmap

- Authentication for multiple users
